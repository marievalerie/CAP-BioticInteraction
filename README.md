# CAP-BioticInteraction

This GitHub repostory contains all scripts used to analyze the RNA-sequencing data sets from three freshwater invertebrate species, which were exposed to the insectcide chlorantraniliprole. Further, the effect of biotic interaction was included in the experimental design.

The repository is associated to the following paper:
